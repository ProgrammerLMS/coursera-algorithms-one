## 1. 3-SUM in quadratic time

### 1.1 Description

Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to $n^2$ in the worst case. You may assume that you can sort the $n$ integers in time proportional to $n^2$ or better.

## 2. Search in a bitonic array

### 2.1 Description

An array is *bitonic* if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of $n$ distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

- Standard version: Use $∼3lg{n}$ compares in the worst case.
- Signing bonus: Use $∼2lg{n}$ compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than $∼2lg{n}$ compares in the worst case).
